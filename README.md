## Community Edition Scripts

### Installer

#### [install.sh](https://github.com/josh-morin/qradar/blob/master/scripts/install.sh)
This bash script will help with setup and installation of QRadar CE 731 GA. 


Setup
1. Upload `install.sh` to the `tmp` directory where you placed the QRadar ISO. 
2. Run the install bash script by using sh. Example: `sh install.sh`

Operation

| Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| System update | Performs a system update of CentOS/RHEL | 
| Disable SELinux | Disables SELinux and reboots CentOS/RHEL |
| QRadar CE install | Mounting ISO and start QRadar CE installation | 
| Set admin password | Launch changePasswd script |
| Restart Tomcat process | Restarts the Tomcat process |
| System reboot | Restarts CentOS/RHEL |

Notes
* You will need to have the host operating system running before using this script. 
* After disabling SELinux the auto-rebooting is performed to allow disablement of SELinux to take effect. 
  - This is required and found in the official documentation under "Installing an operating system for QRadar Community Edition."
* Selection #3 will be selected twice due to system reboot for a kernel update. I added selection #6 for this purpose. 
  - Details can be found in the official documentation under "Installing an operating system for QRadar Community Edition."
* Added the changePasswd script as requested in the official documentation. 
* Added restarting of the Tomcat process as requested in the official documentation. 
  - Restarting the Tomcat process can take some time. You will see a blinking underscore cursor below the script selection menu until its finished. 
* During installation, it might appear to stall out at the following: `Console setup, stopped services: host context http tomcat hostservices.`  Press enter, and it will proceed to `applying template Enterprise.`
